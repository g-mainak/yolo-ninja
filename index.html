	<h3>Getting and Maintaining Zoo Accounts</h3>
	<div>
		<p><small>To apply for a Zoo account, use the account request script. Your NetID will be your UserID on the zoo. Individuals who do not have a NetID must go to Workstation Support Services on the ground floor of AKW to have an account created manually. You should also use the account script to register the CS classes you're taking at the beginning of each semester. Doing so will ensure that the system adds you to the proper groups and creates the necessary working-directories in your home directory. It'll even archive your course-work for you at the end of the semester! You may register as often as necessary if you later decide to take additional courses. Registration data from the form is processed periodically by a Workstation Support staff member throughout the day. You will receive e-mail confirmation once your registration has been processed.Your Zoo account entitles you to, among other things, 60MB of space on Artemis, the central file server for the Zoo; a URL at which to publish HTML documents (see the Web Publishing section of this help system for more information); and a nice, comfy office swivel-chair (not to be removed from the Zoo!).Finally, make sure you read the Etiquette page to familiarize yourself with the rules and regs.
		</small></p>
		<button>Get a Zoo acount!<a href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/cgi-bin/accounts.pl"></a></button>
	</div>

	<h3>Logging In</h3>
	<div><p><small>Logging in is a simple process. Sit down at a node, and press Return if necessary to get the login prompt (the workstations blank their screens after a while to prevent burn-in). Type your NetID and password where indicated, choose a kernel if desired and press Go.</small></p>
	</div>

	<h3>Changing Your Password</h3>
	<div>
	<p><small>To change your password go to Yale ITS' password maintenance page.
		For tips on password protection please see ITS' article Protecting your Yale NetID.
		Keep in mind that anyone who knows your password has unrestricted access to your account and the information within. You should be the only person with this access. Anyone who logs into your account has the ability to alter or damage the data within, as well as to represent him or herself as you on the internet. To make sure that only you have access to your account, please observe these guidelines:
		Never give your password to anyone. Likewise, don't try to obtain other people's passwords. If you need to share files or programs with someone else, you can provide limited access to certain files and directories by making them world- or group-readable, or by using a collaborative development system like RCS or CVS.
		If you suspect that someone is tampering with your account, change your password. It is actually a good idea to change your password on a regular basis (once a month is reasonable, more frequently if you are paranoid).
		Do not write your password down or save it in a file on your account. Such information all too easily ends up in the wrong hands.</small></p>
	</div>

	<h3>Changing Your Shell</h3>
	<div>
	<p><small>When you log in and get to a prompt the operating system starts a program called a shell, which allows you to launch programs and interact with the file system. All commands you type at the shell's prompt are interpreted and executed by the shell.
		There are several different shells, and you may not like the default shell. If you'd like to change your shell, type ypchsh. The /usr/bin/chsh program (short for change shell) will display your old shell and ask you for a new one. The preferred method for changing your shell is through the web interface at http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/accounts.html. The list of supported shells in the Zoo includes (but is not limited to):
		/bin/tcsh
		Tcsh, an enhanced version of the Berkeley UNIX C Shell, csh.
		/bin/bash
		Bash, the "Bourne Again Shell," which is the standard GNU shell.
		/bin/csh
		The Berkeley UNIX C shell; considered harmful by some authorities.
		/bin/zsh
		Zsh, the Z Shell, designed for compatibility with ksh, the Korn Shell.
		/bin/sh
		The generic Bourne shell. Not recommended.</small></p>
	</div>

	<h3>Setting Up Your Environment</h3>
	<div>
	<p><small>Initially your login environment will have a plain-vanilla setup. You may want to customize your login and logout procedures, your shell, and your window manager. This setup is done by editing certain files in your account, called dot files (because their names begin with a dot (.) character). The default behavior of ls is to ignore dot files, so you may wish to run it with the -a option to have them displayed. Here are a few tips to get you started:
		Most of the dot files for the shells are just a list of commands for the shell to execute when it starts (i.e., when you log in). By customizing these files, you can have your shell perform certain tasks for you automatically. For example, add the line /usr/games/fortune to your .bashrc file (if you're using bash as your shell) to run the fortune program, which prints out a random inspirational / humorous quote, every time you log in. See the documentation for your particular shell for more information on customizing its dot file.
		You can use the "Session" menu on the login screen to specify a window manager (controls the display and management of windows X applications) or a desktop manager (creates a 'desktop') interface -- a trash bin and icons for disk drives, e.g. Desktop managers often include built-in window managers or launch a window manager of your choice).
		The desktop managers installed on the Zoo include:
		/usr/bin/gnome-session
		Gnome
		/usr/bin/kdeinit
		KDE
		The window managers installed on the Zoo include:
		/usr/bin/sawfish
		(Sawfish, a lightweight, themeable window manager.
		/usr/bin/wmaker
		Window Maker, the official GNUstep window manager.
		/usr/bin/icewm
		IceWM, whose goal is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user's way.
		/usr/bin/fvwm
		FVWM, the Fill-in-the-blank-with-whatever-word-you-like-at-the-time Virtual Window Manager.</small></p>

		<h3>Where we at?</h3>
		<div><p><small>The Zoo is located on the third floor of Arthur K. Watson Hall (the Computer Science Department building) at 51 Prospect Street. One half of the Zoo is enclosed in Room AKW300, while the other half is in the third floor atrium.
		The Zoo is open 24-hours a day, so if you're noctournal (like some of us) and thus do your best hacking at night, you need not be concerned. Just keep in mind that the door into AKW is locked on weekends and in the evenings on weekdays, so you will want to have your ID card validated for use with the scanner in order to enter the building during those times. Entrance to the closed portion of the Zoo (AKW300) also requires a swipe from a validated card. At the time of this writing (Fall 2002), Lori Hammel is in charge of ID card validations. Her desk is at the end of the right-hand hallway on the ground floor of AKW. Be sure to list all the areas of the building to which you will require access when you sign up for ID validation.
		The Zoo has a telephone (aren't we hip?) so that you can call your friends there to remind them to eat and sleep. The phone number for the closed portion of the Zoo is 432-2266; for the open portion, 432-2169.'</small>
